# Introduction to Django Channels and Asynchronous Programming

`Channels` are the python project which was created to extend the ability of Django to the next level.\
We were working in standard Django which did not support `asynchronous` and channels and connection via WebSockets to create `real-time` applications.\
`Channels` extend the ability of Django beyond `HTTP` and make it work with `WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more`.\
It is built on `ASGI` support which stands for `Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface`.\
`ASGI` is the successor of `WSGI` which provides an interface between async and python.\
`Channels` provide the functionality of ASGI, by extending WSGI to it, and it provides `ASGI support with WSGI`.
`Channels` also bundle the event-driven architecture with the channel layers.\
system that allows you to easily communicate between processes and separate your project into different processes.
